# ASCII Image Generator in Python

Turn any image into text art. Pixels become characters. Light becomes space, dark becomes density. It’s like teaching your terminal to draw.

This script reads an image, converts it to grayscale, resizes it for console display, and maps each pixel’s brightness to an ASCII character to create an ASCII-art version of the image.

An image file called `image.jpg`

Output:  
A block of ASCII characters printed directly in your terminal that visually resembles the image.

Example concept:


<img width="861" height="810" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-14 223356" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54d856a1-9207-4574-8ad9-4e5b40881c01" />
